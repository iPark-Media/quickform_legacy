 Image_Graph - Changelog
*************************
Version 0.2.0 [devel] - Jesper Veggerby <pear.nosey@veggerby.dk>
	* First PEAR version - GraPHPite changes to Image_Graph
	* Changed Image_Graph_Axis_Sequential to Image_Graph_Axis_Category
	* Changed default X-axis to be Image_Graph_Axis_Category
	* Changed all plot types to be stackable
		- This implies removing Image_Graph_Plot_Stacked_Bar, Image_Graph_Plot_Stacked_Bar100Pct,
		  Image_Graph_Plot_Stacked_Area, Image_Graph_Plot_MultipleData
		- Modified the way axis handling is done - no user impact
	* Removed Image_Graph_Plot_Bar_Horizontal
	* Modified management of axis maxima
	* Removed Image_Graph_Text completely, replaced by Image_Graph_Element::write() - performance improvement
	* Added possibility to draw graph on an existing image
	* Added caching capability
	* Added Image_Graph_Axis_Marker_Area and Image_Graph_Axis_Marker_Line
	* Added marks to axis (a value marker, i.e. an arrow or a ranged box)
	* Fixed bug where stacked / multiple charts containing all zeros in datasets did not display or gave a division by zero error in Axis.php
	* Modified Image_Graph_Fill_Gradient for better performance
	* Added Image_Graph::factory and Image_Graph::layoutFactory methods, mainly for lazy include
	* Removed Include.php, use either factory methods or include necessary files manually
	* Added Image_Graph_Simple for very simple creation of graphs
	* Added secondary y-axis
	* Changed internal color scheme to use Image_Color - user impact:
		- Image_Graph::newColor(), Image_Graph::addColor removed
		- Uses Image_Graph_Color from 'old' Image_Graph package, which statically uses 
		  Image_Graph_Color::allocateColor() and Image_Graph_Color::color2RGB()
		- Constants IMAGE_GRAPH_[COLORNAME] removed. Use string names, i.e. 'white', 'blue' as
		  defined by Image_Color (now a dependency)
		- Standard 'string' color formats supported
	* Added internal error handler Image_Graph_Common::_error() which uses PEAR_ErrorStack and Log
	* Changed Image_Graph_Marker_PercentageCircle to Image_Graph_Marker_Bubble
	* Changed logo
	* Changed all strings using double quotes to single quotes for performance

Version 1.2 [2004-Sep-15] - Jesper Veggerby <pear.nosey@veggerby.dk>
	* Fixed some more errors caused by error_reporting using E_NOTICE
	* Documentation brush up
	* Added logarithmic axis
	* Tested with PHP5
	* License changed from GPL to LGPL	
	* Changed to accomodate PEAR standards
		- All classes are now named according to PEAR naming scheme, i.e. Image_Graph_*
		- All class methods are sturdy caps i.e. Element::done(), Axis::forceMinimum()
		- Include files are now named .php instead of .inc
		- File structure changed
		- All private variables/methods are prefixed with a _ (should have no effect on usage since
		  they are (should be!) private)
	* Axis' are now returned via the Plotarea::getAxis() method
	* Add methods now return a reference to the object, instead of the 'odd' way of creating
	  global variables, i.e.:
		$Graph->addPlot(new Plot(), 'Plot');
	  is changed to:
		$Plot =& $Graph->addPlot(new Plot());
	* Coloring scheme changed so that named colors are now linked to a 24 bit integer value
	  instead of the objects. setFillColor, setLineColor, setBorderColor and 
	  setBackgroundColor instead of the corresponding -Style, to use the named colors). The
	  colors are named according to the PEAR naming scheme: IMAGE_GRAPH_[COLOR], fx 
	  IMAGE_GRAPH_RED
	* Included (a few) examples in the distribution

Version 1.1 [2004-Aug-16] - Jesper Veggerby <pear.nosey@veggerby.dk>
	* Added support for legends in PlotTypeMultipleData (i.e. StackedBarChart, StackedAreaChart and StackedBarChart100Pct)
	* Added step-, impulse-, horizontal bar- and dot chart (dot chart is marker only chart)
	* Added AxisSequential for using a non-numerical axis (i.e x-values '1st quarter', '2nd quarter', etc.) for use 'instead' of a ArrayData preprocessor for labelling
	* Added setLineColor, setFillColor, setBackgroundColor and setBorderColor to allow settting colors directly using RGB values instead of Color objects
	* Added PlotareaMap to allow for map charts
	* Added FloodFillMarker and PercentageCircleMarker
	* Changed CircleMarker to use polygon instead of arc, to allow (proper) non-solid filling
	* Fixed Title to work when used in a Layout
	* Added a secondary Marker to the Marker class to allow for multiple/'nested' markers
	* Added global variable DEFAULT_VERTICAL_FONT (which is an instance of VerticalFont)
	* Added PlotareaLayout - a standard layout with plot- and axis- titles (using DEFAULT_FONT!)
	* Added showShadow to GraPHPElement to allow *any* element to be able to show shadows! Note however it may not always look good
	* 'Re'-fixed bug #989601 - Pixel oddities
	* Changed Documentation to NOT include source code - to reduce documentation size (approx 2Mb)

	* Changed PieCharts to use polygon instead of arc, to allow (proper) non-solid filling
	* Fixed bug #982634 - GradientFill on BarChart broken in 0.9e?
	* Fixed bug #989601 - Pixel oddities
	* Legends with GradientFill or ImageFill now shows correctly (FillArray shows the 'next in line')
